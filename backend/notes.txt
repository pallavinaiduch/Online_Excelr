Java:
-----
    -java is a programming language
    -java is a high level language, object oriented language,
     class based language
    -java is a platform independent language
    - we can develop desktop application ,web application, mobile application etc


History:
-------
    -java was developed in 1991 by  sun micro system 
              -james gosling(green team)
              -patrick
              -Mike
            
    -java was introduced in 1995 by james gosling(father of java)
    -in the year of 1996 they released java 1.0(jdk 1.0)
         jdk-java development kit
         jre-java runtime environment
         jvm-java virtual machine

jdk-it consist of jre  and development tools
jre-it consist of jvm and set of libraries
jvm-it consist of bytecode interpreter  , used to execute bytecode



platform independent:
---------------------
     - it means write code once run anywhere(WORA)
     - to execute a java file we need 
         1.compiler:
                   - it is a tool which converts source code into byte code
                   - ___.java(source code) ----->____.class(bytecode)

         2.interpreter:
                   - it is a jvm which executes bytecode

Note : java is a platform independent but jvm dependent

java features:
-------------
1.platform independent
2.object oriented:
               1.inheritance
               2.polymorphism
               3.encapsulation
               4.abstraction
3.java is simple and easy to learn
4.java is secure :
               -no pointers, which eliminate the need for memory management
               -java has a inbuilt security manager which prevents
                 unauthorized access to the system
5.java is robust:
                 -strong management of memory
                 -it has a garbage collector which deletes
                  unused objects
6.java is multi threaded
                - supports multi threading, allowing you to run 
                 multiple tasks at the same time
7.java is dynamic language and case sensitive
8.java has rich standard library
------------------------------------------------------------------------

java structure:
---------------

   class className{
    
    public static void main(String[]args){
        ------
        ------
        ------
        }
    }

Note : main method is the entry point of java program
       without main method java program will not run but we can compile
         
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tokens :
      - tokens are the basic building blocks of a java program
      - tokens are used to define the structure of a java program
      - tokens are the elements of a java program 
      - types :
              1.keywords
              ++++++++++
                        :inbuilt words and reserved words
                        :all keywords are in lowercase
                    ex: public static void if else for while switch case 

              2.identifiers
              +++++++++++++
                       : names providing by programmer or developer
                       
                Rules:(mandatory)
                       : keywords cannot be used as identifiers
                       : identifiers are not start with digits and 
                         special characters except $ and _
                Conventions:(optional but recommended)
                       : identifiers should be in camel case
                       ex: firstNameProgram
                       : for class/interface name use pascal case
                       ex: FirstNameProgram
                       : for method and variable name use snake case/camel case
                       ex: first_name

              3.literals
              +++++++++++
                        : literal is a value/data assigned to a variable

                ex:    int        valueName        =        10
                     datatype    identifier   assigning   value/literal

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
variables:
-----------
        - variables are used to store data/ values

      based on datatype:  
        - if we storing primitive datatype then it is called primitive variable
            int a=10;   (a- primitive variable)
        - if we storing non primitive datatype then it is called non primitive variable
            String b="hello";  (b- non primitive variable)

      based on scope:
        - if we storing variable inside method/constructor then it is called local variable
         Note : local variable can be accessed only inside method/constructor but not outside
        - if we storing variable inside class and outside method then it is called global variable
         Note : global variable can be accessed inside and outside method
                global variables are two types:   
                     1.static variable
                     2.instance/non static variable


variable declaration:
             -providing name to a variable
ex: int a;
variable initialization: 
              -assigning a value to a variable
ex:  a=10;    ex2: int b=30;
variable reinitialization:
              -reassigning a value to a variable
              (removing old value and adding new value)
ex: int a=20;    
        a=30;

Note : local variable can be used after it is initialized
       global variable can be used before it is initialized and it gives
       default value according to datatype

              4.operators:
              +++++++++++
                       1.arithmetic operators  
                               ---> + - * / %  (binary operator)
                       2.relational operators  
                               ---> < > <= >= == != (binary operator)
                       3.logical operators     
                               ---> && || (binary operator) !(unary operator)
                       4.assignment operators  
                              ---> = += -= *= /= %= (binary operator)
                       5.bitwise operators     
                              ---> & | ^ ~ << >> (binary operator)
                       6.conditional operators 
                              ---> (operand1?operand2:operand3) (ternary operator)
                       7.increment/decrement operators
                              ---> ++ -- (unary operator)
                       8.access operator (.) -unary operator

Precedence / priority of operators:   
              1.()
              2.unary operators
              3.multiplication/division
              4.addition/subtraction
              5.relational operators
              6.equality operators
              7.logical  and operator
              8.logical or operator
              9.ternary operator

              5.separators
              ++++++++++++
                       1.comma
                       2.semicolon
                       3.curly brackets
                       4.parenthesis


Note : tokens are case sensitive

creating java project in eclipse:

        clt+N---->choose java project in wizard----->next
        provide projectName ---->next---->finish 

package: 
       - it is a folder which contains java classes and interface.
       - a file must be unique in a package.
library (jar file):
       - it consist collection of packages
jre system library:
       - it consist collection of jar files(libraries)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Casting :
        -converting one data type to another data type
        -there are two types of casting:
            1.primitive type casting
                   - convert one primitive data type to another primitive data type
                   -1.implicit casting : it is done automatically by the compiler
                   -2.explicit casting : it is done manually by the developer ,
                                         so need to use cast operator ()
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                    implicit                         explicit
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
also known as                      widening  typecasting        narrowing typecasting
conversion                         small to big                 big to small 
cast operator                      optional                     mandatory
loss of data                       no                           yes
example                            byte-->double                double------>byte 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
order of data types:
  byte (8 bits)<short(16 bits)
                               <int (32 bits)<long (64 bits)<float (32 bits)<double(64 bits)
               <char(16 bits)
